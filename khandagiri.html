                <p>Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, formerly called Kattaka Caves or Cuttack caves, are partly natural & partly artificial caves of archaeological, historical and religious importance near the city of Bhubaneswar in Odisha, India. The caves are situated on two adjacent hills, Udayagiri and Khandagiri mentioned as Kumari Parvata in the Hathigumpha inscription.[1] They have a number of finely and ornately carved caves built during the 1st century BCE.[2][3] It is believed that most of these caves were carved out as residential blocks for Jain monks during the reign of King Kharavela.[4] Udayagiri means "Sunrise Hill" and has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves.[5]

                    The caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, called lena or leá¹‡a in the inscriptions, these were taken out mostly during the reign of Kharavela for the abode of Jain ascetics. The most importance of this group was Ranigumpha in Udayagiri which is a double storeyed monastery. Other important caves include Hathi Gumpha, Ananta Gumpha, Ganesha Gumpha, Jaya Vijaya Gumpha, Mancapuri Gumpha, Bagha/Byaghra/Vyaghra Gumpha and Sarpa Gumpha.[6]
                    
                    Archaeological Survey of India has listed that Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves in the list of "Must See" Indian Heritage.[3]
                    
                    The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves are listed as one of the Adarsh Smarak Monument by Archaeological Survey of India.[7]
                    
                    Count of the caves
                    B. M. Barua, based on a reading of line 14 of the Hathi Gumpha inscription, declared that a total of 117 caves were excavated by Kharavela and others on the Kumari hill (Udayagiri). Marshall has counted more than 35 caves in both the hills, while M.M. Ganguli has enumerated only 27 caves.[8]
                    
                    The number of existing caves at Udayagiri is 18, while Khandagiri has 15.[9] The local names of the existing caves are listed below, numbered according to the enumeration of the Archaeological Survey of India.

                    Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
                    In Udayagiri, Hathi Gumpha (cave 14) and Ganesha Gumpha (cave 10) are especially well known for their historically important sculptures and reliefs. Raninka Na'ara (Queen's Palace Cave, Cave 1) is also an extensively carved cave and elaborately embellished with sculptural friezes.[6] Khandagiri offers a fine view back over Bhubaneswar from its summit. The Ananta Cave (Cave 3) depicts carved figures of women, elephants, athletes, and geese carrying flowers.[10]
                    
                    Caves at Udayagiri
                    The Udayagiri hills are on the right-hand side as the visitor approaches from Bhubaneswar. Compared to Khandagiri, Udayagiri offers more beautiful and better maintained cave shrines. There are 18 caves in Udayagiri:[11]
                    
                    1. Rani Gumpha "Cave of the Queen"
                    Rani Gumpha is the largest and most popular cave among the caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri.[12] The word Rani means "queen".[13] Although it is not an architectural marvel, it has some ancient beautiful sculptures.
                    
                    This cave is double storeyed. Each storey has three wings and the central wing is bigger among all the three wings. The lower floor has seven entrances in the middle wing whereas the upper floor has nine columns. The upper portion of the central wing has relief images depicting the victory march of a king. Many of the cells have carved dwara pala images;[14] some of them are disfigured. The area that connects the central wing with right and left wings have some panels where the sculptures of wild animals, fruit-laden trees, human figures, women playing musical instruments, monkeys and playful elephants are found.</p>
